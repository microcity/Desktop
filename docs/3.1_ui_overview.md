# 3.1 User Interfaces Overview
MicroCity provides a concise graphic windowed interface to facilitate the manipulation of data and modules. 
## The Main Window and Components

## Supported Files
MicroCity can open ArcGIS shapefile (*.shp), Grids file (*.sgrd), dBase file (*.dbf), Tabular text file (*.csv, *.txt), Point clouds (*.spc), Image file (*.bmp, *.gif, *.jpg, *.png, *.tif, *.pcx) and MicroCity 3D Scene (*.m3d). These data files are maintained in **Data** Tab of **Workspace** Panel. Module libraries (*.dll, *.mcs) are maintained and executed through **Modules** Tab of **Workspace** Panel. 
## Project Management
The information of opened data files, module libraries, settings and sub-windows can be stored in a **MicroCity Project (*.mprj)**. The mprj file does not contain any **file's data**. For easy maintenance, files in a project should be put into a same folder or sub-folders of the mprj file.
