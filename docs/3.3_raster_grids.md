# 3.3 Raster Grids
MicroCity can open, create and edit SAGA Grid (*.sgrd) which are called **Grid** and maintained in the **Data** Tab of the **Workspace** Panel. Image files (*.bmp, *.gif, *.jpg, *.png, *.tif, *.pcx) can be opened as **Grid** as well. By using **modules** (see [3.7](3.7_modules.md)) other raster file formats, such like ESRI Arc/Info Grid (*.adf) and Surfer Grid (*.grd), can also be imported or exported.
## Opening, Creating, Saving and Closing Grids
Users can click **Load** button ![button](imgs/button_load.png) or **File->Grid->Load** menu item to open a **Grid**. Creating new **Grid** can be done from menu **File->Grid->New** and the pop-up dialog:

![new grid](imgs/new_grid.png) ![grid_structure](imgs/grid_structure.png)
