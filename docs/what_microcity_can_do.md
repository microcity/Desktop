# What MicroCity can Do
MicroCity is designed to be a handy spatial planning tool, which is **portable, compact and fast**.
## A Modeling Framework
Based on GIS, Networks and Mixed Integer Programming libraries, MicroCity can be used as a modeling framework to solve transporation problems, such as **City Logistics and Shipping Planning:**<br/>

## A Simulation Platform
Based on 3D CGI, Discrete Event Engine, MicroCity can be used as a simulation platform to evaluate logistic scenarios, such as **Automated Warehouse Simulation and Container Terminal Simulation:**<br/>
